Python code for crawling YouTube comments



How to execute:

1. Enter a valid Youtube Link, without including any link beyond the character '&'.
e.g.: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"

2. Enter the total number of comments you wish to retrieve.

3. Enter the 'mod' number.
e.g.: A 'mod' number of 10 will cause the crawler to only save 1 comment out of every 10 comments crawled.

4. Enter the file name including the .csv extension.
e.g.: "temp.csv"

5. The final file will be generated at the same place as the 'main.py' file.
